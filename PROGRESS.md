# PROGRESS.md - CI/CD Clean Slate + Auto-Migrations

## 2026-05-16: Complete CI/CD Rewrite + Automatic DB Migrations

### Removed Files
- `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` - Will re-add when needed
- `.github/workflows/debug-logs.yml` - Unused
- `.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml` - Unused
- `.github/workflows/secret-scanning.yml` - Unused
- Old `scripts/deploy-remote.sh` - Too complex, buggy

### Created Files
1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Clean CI with postgres+redis services, lint, typecheck, security checks, test, build, docker validate
2. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Build 4 images to GHCR, SSH deploy to VM
3. `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` - Weekly CodeQL scan
4. `scripts/deploy-remote.sh` - Clean VM deploy script (no repo clone, auto .env, DB backup, automatic migrations)
5. `scripts/vm-reset.sh` - Complete VM wipe for fresh start

### CRITICAL: Automatic DB Migrations on Startup
- **Problem**: Previously, production deploys did NOT run DB migrations. Fresh VM = empty DB = crash.
- **Solution**: Added `runMigrations()` to `apps/backend/src/db/index.ts`
- **Integration**: `index.ts` now calls `await runMigrations()` BEFORE `fastify.listen()`
- **Mechanism**: Uses `drizzle-orm/postgres-js/migrator` to apply all `.sql` files from `drizzle/` folder
- **Safety**: Drizzle tracks applied migrations in `__drizzle_migrations` table — idempotent, runs safely on every startup
- **Fallback**: `migrate.ts` script still exists for manual runs if needed

### Docker Compose Changes
- `docker-compose.prod.yml`: Backend `start_period` increased from 15s to 60s
  - Reason: First deploy needs time for postgres to start + migrations to run (22 migration files)
  - Other services unchanged (15s)

### Deploy Script Changes
- No manual migration step needed (runs automatically on container startup)
- DB backup still runs before deploy if postgres is already running
- Health check waits up to 120s (60 attempts x 2s) to account for first-deploy migrations
- Added comment: "DB migrations run automatically when backend container starts"

### Verification Results
| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `tsc --noEmit` (backend) | 0 errors |
| `turbo run typecheck` (all 8 packages) | 0 errors, 7/7 pass |
| `turbo run build` (all 8 packages) | 8/8 pass |
| `vitest run` (backend) | 37/37 files, 828/828 tests pass |
| YAML syntax | OK (0 tabs, valid structure) |
| Bash scripts | OK (shebang + strict mode + LF endings) |

### Next Steps for Deploy
1. Commit all changes: `git add -A && git commit -m "ci/cd: clean rewrite + auto db migrations"`
2. Push to `main`
3. On VM (if full reset needed): `bash ~/spaceship/scripts/vm-reset.sh`
4. Trigger deploy from GitHub Actions → Deploy workflow → Run workflow
5. First deploy auto-creates `.env.production` with secure random secrets
6. Backend container starts → runs migrations → starts server → healthy

### VM Reset Script Usage
```bash
# SSH into VM, then:
bash ~/spaceship/scripts/vm-reset.sh
# This removes: all containers, images, volumes, networks, and ~/spaceship directory
# Use this for a COMPLETELY fresh start
```
